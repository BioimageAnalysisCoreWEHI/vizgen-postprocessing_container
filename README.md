# Vizgen Post-processing Tool Apptainer

This repo is for building and deploying an Apptainer, for running the [Vizgen Post-processing Tool](https://github.com/Vizgen/vizgen-postprocessing/) using the [vpt-plugin-cellpose2](https://github.com/Vizgen/vpt-plugin-cellpose2) plugin. The container definition code has been adapted from the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Vizgen/vizgen-postprocessing/blob/develop/Dockerfile) included in the VPT repository.
